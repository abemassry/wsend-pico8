# Info

I needed a quick place to show
a [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) game and
I didn't want to post it to the blog because it was super in progress
but I wanted someone else to be able to play it and try it out on
a webpage. So I made this quick tool, to share it quickly.

Here's an example
